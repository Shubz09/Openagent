For Those Seeking the Standard Process (Curious Learners) 
GitHub Proficiency Assessment by AI Bot:
Cloning a repo: Cloning a repo means creating a copy of it on your local machine. To do this, you can use the git clone command. For example, to clone the GitHub repository for the Python 30 Days of Code: 

https://github.com/Hotmansifu/Python30Days project, you would use the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Hotmansifu/Python30Days.git

Difference between fork and clone: A fork is a copy of a repository that you create on your own GitHub account. A clone is a copy of a repository that you create on your local machine. The main difference between the two is that you can make changes to a fork and push those changes back to the original repository, while you can only make changes to a clone and push those changes to your own fork.

Understanding of remote origin: The origin remote is the default remote repository for a GitHub project. It is the repository that you cloned from, or the repository that you forked from. You can use the git remote command to list all of the remote repositories for a project.

Creating a branch: A branch is a way to track changes to a project independently. To create a branch, you can use the git checkout -b <branch_name> command. For example, to create a branch called new-feature, you would use the following command:

git checkout -b new-feature

Making changes locally: Once you have created a branch, you can make changes to the project files locally. To do this, you can use the git add and git commit commands. The git add command adds the changes to the staging area, and the git commit command commits the changes to the local repository.

Committing those changes: Once you have made your changes, you can commit them to the remote repository. To do this, you can use the git push command. For example, to push the changes from the new-feature branch to the origin remote, you would use the following command:

git push origin new-feature
